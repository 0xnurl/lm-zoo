LM Zoo is a collection of pre-trained language models wrapped as Docker
containers. Each model conforms to the :ref:`api`, which enforces a
standard for accessing and probing the models in psycholinguistic evaluations.

LM Zoo is maintained by the
`MIT Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory <http://cpl.mit.edu/>`_.
