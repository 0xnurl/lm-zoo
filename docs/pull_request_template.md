## Model

Please provide a brief description of the language model, and include all
relevant paper citations as BibTeX entries.

- **Are you the creator/co-creator of this language model?**
- **Are you the creator/co-creator of this implementation of this language
   model?**
- **Is this implementation the official implementation of the language model?**
- **What licensing restrictions (if any) apply to this implementation of this
   language model?**

## Training

- **What corpus was this model trained on?** Provide links and/or citations,
   and some basic statistics if possible (number of tokens/sentences; number of
   word types).
- **What task was this model trained on?** (e.g. next-word prediction, cloze
   language modeling, next-sentence prediction, etc.)

If possible, provide some standard performance measures (e.g. test perplexity)
and complexity measures (e.g. parameter count, number of layers, etc.).
