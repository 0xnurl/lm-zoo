The Language Model Zoo (LM Zoo) is an open-source repository of
state-of-the-art language models, designed to support black-box access to model
predictions and representations. It provides the command line tool ``lm-zoo``,
a standard interface for interacting with language models.

You can use ``lm-zoo`` to extract word-level surprisal data for natural
language text::

  $ wget https://cpllab.github.io/lm-zoo/metamorphosis.txt -O metamorphosis.txt
  $ head -n3 metamorphosis.txt
  One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
  He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
