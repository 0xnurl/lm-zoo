Quickstart
==================

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`lm-zoo` is supported for Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. It requires `Docker
<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ to run language model images.

Language models can be large (4--8 GB in disk space per model) and require a
substantial amount of RAM (2--8 GB). Some language models may require a
reliable desktop machine or a computing cluster to run.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install LM Zoo using the Python package manager ``pip``::

  pip install lm-zoo


Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
  He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
